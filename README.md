# How to use this image

This Docker image is maintained by [Autoize Mautic consultants](https://autoize.com). The latest Mautic version is published after the binaries are released to the open source community by the Mautic team. Our goal is to maintain a constantly updated Docker image that Mautic users can utilize to deploy marketing automation in a containerized environment.

Latest image: The image tagged autoize/mautic:latest is currently Mautic 2.10.0.

Stable image: The image tagged autoize/mautic:stable is currently Mautic 2.9.2.

If you are using Mautic in production, it may be advisable to stay on the stable image while the Mautic team gathers feedback from the community and issues bug fixes for the latest release. The latest image coincides with the latest release available for Mautic's community edition, with the bleeding-edge features; The stable image is held back to a stable, bug fix release on the immediately previous minor version. 

# Start here
Most users will want to refer to our [step-by-step guide to running Mautic as a Docker container](https://autoize.com/run-mautic-as-a-docker-container/) but we have retained the more technical documentation below for experienced Docker and Docker Compose users.

===================

	docker run --name some-mautic --link some-mysql:mysql -d autoize/mautic

The following environment variables are also honored for configuring your Mautic instance:

-	`-e MAUTIC_DB_HOST=...` (defaults to the IP and port of the linked `mysql` container)
-	`-e MAUTIC_DB_USER=...` (defaults to "root")
-	`-e MAUTIC_DB_PASSWORD=...` (defaults to the value of the `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variable from the linked `mysql` container)
-	`-e MAUTIC_DB_NAME=...` (defaults to "mautic")

If the `MAUTIC_DB_NAME` specified does not already exist on the given MySQL server, it will be created automatically upon startup of the `mautic` container, provided that the `MAUTIC_DB_USER` specified has the necessary permissions to create it.

If you'd like to be able to access the instance from the host without the container's IP, standard port mappings can be used:

	docker run --name some-mautic --link some-mysql:mysql -p 8080:80 -d mautic

Then, access it via `http://localhost:8080` or `http://host-ip:8080` in a browser.

If you'd like to use an external database instead of a linked `mysql` container, specify the hostname and port with `MAUTIC_DB_HOST` along with the password in `MAUTIC_DB_PASSWORD` and the username in `MAUTIC_DB_USER` (if it is something other than `root`):

	docker run --name some-mautic -e MAUTIC_DB_HOST=10.1.2.3:3306 \
	    -e MAUTIC_DB_USER=... -e MAUTIC_DB_PASSWORD=... -d autoize/mautic

## ... via [`docker-compose`](https://github.com/docker/compose)

Example `docker-compose.yml` for `mautic`:

	version: '2'

	services:
	   db:
	     image: mariadb:latest
	     volumes:
	       - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
	     restart: always
	     environment:
	       MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: supersecret
	       MYSQL_DATABASE: mautic
	       MYSQL_USER: mautic
	       MYSQL_PASSWORD: secret

	   mautic:
	     depends_on:
	       - db
	     image: autoize/mautic:stable
	     ports:
	       - "80:80"
	       - "443:443"
	     volumes:
	       - mautic:/var/www/html
	     restart: always
	     environment:
	       MAUTIC_DB_HOST: db:3306
	       MAUTIC_DB_NAME: mautic
	       MAUTIC_DB_USER: mautic
	       MAUTIC_DB_PASSWORD: secret

	volumes:
	    db_data:
	    mautic:

Run `docker-compose up`, wait for it to initialize completely, and visit `http://localhost:8080` or `http://host-ip:8080`.
